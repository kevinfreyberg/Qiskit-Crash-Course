# Seminar 1: Introduction to Quantum Computing

As you might know, classical bits are represented with either 0 or 1. For the longest time, we have utilized classical 
bits for many different applications of computing. However, they contain some limitations--adversaries can copy them.

Quantum computers introduce **qubits**. As opposed to classical bits, qubits are the fundamental units of quantum information.
Unlike classical bits, qubits cannot be copied according to the **no-cloning theorem**. This will prove to be beneficial in our
quantum computing endeavor.

Remember when I mentioned classical bits can be either 0 or 1? What about qubits? 

### Qubit states
Qubits can be 0, 1, or a **superposition** of 0 and 1. Their states are represented through ket-notation:

```  
State 0: |0⟩ 
State 1: |1⟩
Superposition: α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ where α and β are probability amplitudes. 
```
