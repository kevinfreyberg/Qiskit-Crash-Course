# Welcome to the Qiskit Crash Course!

This an introduction to Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing framework from IBM. This guide is inspired by "Learn Quantum Computation using Qiskit" and lectures given by Dr. Walter O. Krawec at the University of Connecticut.

This guide uses Python and it is highly recommended you have at least basic knowledge in the language.
